## Development environment howto

### Development requirements

- Install [pip-deepfreeze](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip-deepfreeze) with `pipx install pip-deepfreeze`
- Install [pip-preserve-requirements](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip-preserve-requirements) with `pipx install pip-preserve-requirements`
- Install [bump2version](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bump2version) with `pipx install bump2version`
- [git-aggregator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/git-aggregator) (`pipx install git-aggregator`) is also occasionally useful to
  combine multiple pull requests into a single branch (see `gitaggregate.yaml`).
- To make git-aggregate run faster on large repositories such as Odoo, it is recommended to install [git-autoshare](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/git-autoshare) with `pipx install
  git-autoshare`. Don't forget to configure it according to the documentation.

### Preliminary steps

- Clone the repository
- Set up Github CLI with `gh auth login` (It is mandatory because gitaggregate will fail the aggregation without returning an error)
- Prepare the project-specific Odoo branch by running `gitaggregate -c gitaggregate.yaml -p`.
- Pin the build dependencies using for CI by running `./sync-build.sh`

### Initialize virtualenv

- Create and activate virtualenv, possibly with virtualenvwrapper's
  `mkvirtualenv odoo-{{ project_name|lower|replace(' ', '-') }} -a . --python=python{{ python_version }}`

### Install everything

Some dependencies are not available on PyPI as manylinux wheels, so you need
to have a C compiler,the Python headers and some additional dev
packages installed in order to compile them. The list of packages can be
found in the `build-deps` stage of the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)

As an alternative, you can reference the wheelhouse from ACSONE in the pip
environment variable before launching the pip-df command::

   export PIP_FIND_LINKS=https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux2014

In an activated python {{ python_version }} virtualenv, run::

   pip-df sync

When dependencies change, use `pip-df sync` again, possibly with
`--update`. Add unmerged VCS dependencies in `requirements.txt.in`. See the
pip-deepfreeze documentation for more information.

### Develop

This project uses [black](https://pypi.org/project/black) and other code formatters.
To make sure local coding convention are respected before
you commit, install [pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit) and
run `pre-commit install` after cloning the repository.

## Run

```
odoo -c odoo.cfg
```

## Running tests

To run tests as usual

```
odoo --test-enable
```

To run tests with pytest Odoo

```
pytest --odoo-database=<dbname> odoo/addons
```

## Release

1. First make sure you have been testing using the correct dependencies by
   running `pip-df sync` and checking there is no change in `requirements*.txt`.
2. Update the version number using `bumpversion patch|minor|major` and push the tag
   that bumpversion created with `git push --follow-tags`.
3. The deploy to the test environment will be automatic, and GitLab will show buttons
   on the pipeline to deploy to other environments.
